<h1> WELCOME</h1>
<p>Welcome to my very first HTML and CSS website! My name is Hiba, and this is a simple and basic page because I’ve just started learning to code. Every great journey begins with a small step, right? This site is my starting point in web development, where I’m experimenting with the essentials of creating and styling webpages. It’s a humble beginning, but I’m excited to learn, grow, and build something more amazing as I explore coding further. Thank you for visiting my little corner of the web!</p>
<p>Today, I’ve added my very first button! It’s simple, but it’s an exciting start for me as I learn how to make my website more interactive. I’m looking forward to adding more features and growing my skills with every update. Thanks for visiting and being a part of my journey!</p>
<p>Today I've linked my first page to a second one on my website. The second page is a simple addition to the first, where I'm practicing the basics of creating and connecting web pages. It’s a small but useful step to understand how multi-page websites work. I'm learning how to structure pages and link them together, and it's been a good experience so far."</p>
